# Description
## For our first major project at Coder Academy in Sydney.
### You are to design, build, deploy and present a portfolio website.
		The website needs to have the following information:

		1. Your name and contact details.
		2. Links to your Github and LinkedIn accounts.
		3. Information about you to demonstrate your personality.
		4. Your study and work history.

		You are allowed to use a CSS library such as Bootstrap
		or even a theme you found on the internet.
		It is advised that you demonstrate you have customised the library or theme.


## Deliverables

### Design Documentation
		1. Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience.

			Concepts should be clear, this is a portfolio of work, it should be fun
			and showcase skill but it needs to be professional as
			potential employers will be looking at it.

		2. Demonstrate the design decisions made:

  		Key concepts I know I want to include
		* Disappearing nav bar when scrolling, and a goto top button.
		* Scaleable portfolio section with mouse interaction.
		* Snake Minigame.
		* vr room
		* contact us page
		* link to browse happy for outdated browsers  
		* main page above the fold.
		* simple mobile design
		* color changing background
		* design must be easy to navigate.
		*


		3. Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics

		My portfolio should be able to tick the 10 heuristics from this page
